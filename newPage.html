		<li>Annuak plants whcich grows from 12 to 18 inches tall, light blue-greenleaves with small tapered buds bursting into a vivid orange bloom.</li>
		<li>California poppies are easy to grow.  </li>
				<ul>
					<li> Sow the seeds shallowly (1/16-inch deep) in fall or early spring in mild, wet winter climates, including most of California west of the Sierra-Nevada. </li>
					<li>Seeds will germinate after the first fall rains or when the soil warms in the spring.</li>
					<li>In hot summer areas, the poppies will bloom in spring and early summer, and then the tops will die back and the plants become dormant during the heat of the summer.The poppy survives in the form of a fleshy taproot.</li>
					<li>In cooler coastal climates, California poppies may bloom most of the summer.</li>
					<li>No supplemental watering is required unless the growing season is exceptionally dry</li>
					<li>In mild-winter climates, these poppies will survive several years, resprouting each fall. They will reseed themselves if they are happy.</li>
			<li>Where winters are cold, the poppy behaves as an annual, renewing itself from seed each year. </li>

				</ul>
			
			<li>The flowers of California poppy close each night, and on cloudy days. Enjoy them where they grow.</li>
